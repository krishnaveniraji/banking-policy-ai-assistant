## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Google Gemini API key (free at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com))

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/krishnaveniraji/banking-policy-ai-assistant
cd banking-policy-ai-assistant

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setup

1. Create `.env` file:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

2. Add PDF documents to project folder:
```
doc1.pdf  ← Your first banking policy PDF
doc2.pdf  ← Your second banking policy PDF
doc3.pdf  ← Your third banking policy PDF
```

3. Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run simple_rag_working.py
```

4. Browser opens at `http://localhost:8501`

## 💡 Key Concepts Learned

### What is RAG?
**Retrieval Augmented Generation** = AI that answers from YOUR documents

**Why RAG over plain ChatGPT?**
| Plain LLM | RAG System |
|-----------|------------|
| May hallucinate | Grounded in real documents |
| No source citations | Shows exact sources |
| Generic knowledge only | Works with private/specific data |
| Can't use recent docs | Uses your latest documents |

### What are Embeddings?
Text converted to numbers (vectors) that capture **meaning**.
Similar meaning = similar numbers = easy to search semantically!

### What is a Vector Database?
Stores embeddings for fast **semantic search**.
"Find me chunks similar to this question" = instant results!

## 🧪 Sample Questions to Test

**Capital Adequacy (doc1.pdf):**
- "What is the minimum CET1 ratio required?"
- "What are the types of risks managed?"
- "How often is capital adequacy reported?"

**KYC & AML (doc2.pdf):**
- "What documents are required for expatriate customers?"
- "When is Enhanced Due Diligence required?"
- "What is the cash transaction reporting threshold?"

**Lending Policy (doc3.pdf):**
- "What is the maximum personal loan for expatriates?"
- "What is the maximum LTV for home loans?"
- "How many days before a loan is classified as Loss?"

## 🎓 My Learning Journey

**Background:** 15+ years Microsoft Power Platform specialist

**Challenge on Day 1:**
- Zero AI projects
- Self-doubt: "I'm not confident enough"
- Wanted to study 3 platforms before building

**What I did instead:**
- Started building immediately
- Debugged 10+ import errors
- Pushed through every obstacle

**Result after 1 day:**
- Working RAG system! 💪
- Proved I can build AI applications
- Ready for Project 2!

**Key lesson:**
> "Start before you feel ready. Build while you learn. 
> Confidence comes from DOING, not from studying more."
